## How to Use
- set ```trackFile``` value to a filename that you'll save the track to. Default to ```track1.txt```.
- run the script.
- click on the screen to place vertices for the path. Edges are generated between consequtive vertices.

### Keybinds
- ```q```: toggles between creating the inside edge and outside edge of the track. By default inside edge.
- ```z```: Undo last placement on the edge.
- ```s```: Save track to file.
